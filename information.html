    <h1>Financial Information</h1>
    <h2>RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)</h2>
    <p>An RRSP is a savings plan that helps Canadians save for retirement. Contributions are tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal. If you are a tax resident with active income and wish to save for the long term or enjoy tax benefits, you are likely to need it.</p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp.html">View details</a>
    <h2>TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)</h2>
    <p>A TFSA allows Canadians to save and invest tax-free. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals are tax-free. If you are over 18 years old and have the corresponding status, and wish to pursue tax benefits or make flexible or long-term investments, it may be of some help.</p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account.html">View details</a>

        <li>The capital market refers to the financial market for securities financing and borrowing of medium and long-term funds for more than one year of operation, while the money market refers to a financial market that operates short-term fund transfers within one year.</li><br>

It has non repayability, participation, profitability, liquidity, price volatility, and risk, and is usually a preferred investment target during periods of high inflation.</li><br>
        <li>Bonds are debt instruments issued to investors by governments, financial institutions, industrial and commercial enterprises, and other institutions that directly borrow from society to raise funds, and promise to pay interest at a certain rate and repay principal according to agreed conditions. It has repayment, liquidity, safety, and profitability.</li><br>
        <li>Fund refers to a collective securities investment method that shares benefits and risks, that is, by issuing fund units, concentrating investors' funds, entrusted by fund custodians, managed and utilized by fund managers, and engaging in financial instrument investments such as stocks and bonds. It is usually divided into open-end funds (the total amount of fund issuance is not fixed, and the total number of fund units can increase or decrease at any time) and closed-end funds (the total amount of issuance is determined in advance, and the total number of fund units remains unchanged during the closed-end period).</li><br>
        <li>The primary market refers to the issuance market, where investors can subscribe to stocks and other securities issued by the company. The secondary market refers to the circulating market, which is a place for buying and selling securities such as issued stocks.</li><br>
        <li>Financial management is learning to handle and use money reasonably, effectively arrange personal or family expenses, make correct financial investments while meeting the needs of normal life, purchase various financial products suitable for oneself, and maximize the preservation and appreciation of assets.</li><br>
        <li>A budget is a calculation plan for a defined period. Preparing a budget allows companies, authorities, private entities or families to establish priorities and evaluate the achievement of their objectives. In the field of commerce, a budget is also a financial document or report that details the cost that a service will have if performed. A budget may express a surplus or a deficit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Finance Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a budget and stick to it.</li>
      <li>Save at least 20% of your income.</li>
      <li>Invest in low-cost index funds for long-term growth.</li>
      <li>When choosing financial products, it is important to understand one's assets, goals, risk tolerance, as well as the volatility and risks of the products.</li>
      <li>High returns mean high risks. Walk within your means and don't blindly invest in projects you don't understand.</li>
      <li>The purpose of financial management is not to make money, but to preserve and increase the value of assets and manage risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p><b>Positive Case 1:</b> John is a middle-aged engineer with a stable and high annual salary. He realized that as he grew older, he needed to make long-term plans for his retirement life. So John started using RRSP for savings. He invests a portion of his income into RRSP every year to enjoy tax incentives. At the same time, he chose to invest the funds in RRSP in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in order to achieve stable growth in returns. After years of accumulation, John's RRSP account has become quite substantial. He plans to gradually withdraw funds from his RRSP after retirement to supplement his pension. Due to his expectation that the tax rate after retirement will be lower than during the working stage, saving and withdrawing through RRSP can effectively reduce the overall tax burden.</p>
    <p><b>Positive Case 2:</b> Sarah is a young freelancer with significant income fluctuations. She hopes to find an investment method that can enjoy tax benefits and flexible access. So she chose TFSA. Sarah deposits a portion of her income into TFSA every year and invests it in low-cost index funds. Due to the tax-free investment income in TFSA, she does not have to worry about the tax burden caused by capital appreciation. At the same time, the flexibility of TFSA also allows her to withdraw funds at any time to respond to emergencies or make other investments. After years of investment, Sarah's TFSA account has achieved considerable returns. She plans to continue using TFSA for long-term investments in the future to achieve asset preservation and appreciation.</p>
    <p><b>Negative Case 1:</b> Vincent is an investor with limited knowledge of financial markets. He heard that a certain stock fund had performed well in the past few years, so he decided to invest all his savings into it. However, he did not fully understand the risk level and investment strategy of the fund, nor did he diversify his investment portfolio. Shortly thereafter, the investment strategy of the fund encountered market changes, resulting in a significant decline in returns. Vincent was forced to sell the fund due to the inability to bear huge losses, resulting in investment failure.</p>
    <p><b>Negative Case 2:</b> Sophia is a young white-collar worker with stable income but lacks financial awareness. She often shops and spends without a plan, resulting in monthly expenses far exceeding her income. Although she has tried to set a budget, she always struggles to stick to it due to various reasons. As time passed, Sophia's debt gradually accumulated and she had to rely on credit card overdrafts and borrowing to sustain her livelihood. This not only puts enormous pressure on her financial situation, but also affects her credit record and future borrowing ability.</p>
