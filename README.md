# Cash Vibes (Initial Individual Version)

Cash Vibes is a web-based project designed to introduce basic financial concepts
through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

This repository contains my **initial individual implementation** of the project,
created before the final team integration.

## Description
The project includes a homepage and an information page that presents financial
topics. The information page also features an interactive quiz-based mini-game
designed to engage users and reinforce learning.

## Included Pages
- `homepage.html` — Project landing page and navigation
- `information.html` — Information page with an embedded quiz game

## Features
- Static webpage layout using HTML and CSS
- Embedded interactive quiz game logic
- Responsive and user-friendly page design

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Scope Note
This repository represents an **early-stage personal version** of the project.
It does **not** include database integration, authentication, or financial
calculation features that were later implemented during the team collaboration.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to showcase my front-end design and interactive
logic development skills as part of a web programming course.
